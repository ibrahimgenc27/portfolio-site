ISE-201 - WEB TECHNOLOGIES 
Project Assignment: Web Application Development 
1. Purpose of the Assignment 
The purpose of this project is to enable students to develop an interactive web application from scratch using modern client-side web technologies. Students will create dynamic interfaces using HTML5, CSS3, and 
modern JavaScript (ES6+), access external or 
local data using the fetch API, and version their projects using Git. 
2. General Technical Requirements (Mandatory for All Projects)
● Platform: The project should not require a server-side language (PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET, Python, etc.). It should consist entirely of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
● Architecture: Semantic HTML5 tags should be used. The project structure should clearly separate HTML (content), CSS (style), and JavaScript (logic) files. 
● Architecture: Semantic HTML5 tags must be used. The project structure must ensure a clear separation of HTML (content), 
CSS (style), and JavaScript (logic) files. 
(inline style/script should not be used). 
● Data Management: A server-side database will not be used. The project must use one of the following methods to manage data:
○ Local JSON File: Reading data from a .json file added to the project using fetch.
(Recommended method.)
○ Local Storage: Storing simple data such as settings, preferences, or to-do lists in the browser. 
○ External API: Fetching data (with fetch) from a free and publicly available REST API (e.g., The 
Movie DB, OpenWeatherMap, REST Countries). 
● Interface (UI): The interface must be fully responsive (mobile, tablet, and desktop 
compatible). 
○ CSS Flexbox and/or CSS Grid should be used for design. 
○ Optionally, a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS can be used, 
but writing CSS from scratch is encouraged. 
● Version Control: The project development process should be managed using Git from the beginning 
and maintained on a GitHub repository. 
3. Project Options
Students will develop only one (1) of the two (2) projects listed below. 
Option 1: Interactive Media Library (SPA) 
Objective: An application that pulls movie/TV series/book information using an external API or local JSON file and 
lists, filters, and displays details in a modern interface. 
Technologies: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+), fetch API, localStorage. 
Required Features: 
● List/Grid View: Display all media (movies, TV shows, etc.) as cards. 
● Search and Filtering: Search media by name and filter by category/year. 
● Details Page: When a media item is clicked, display all its details (rating, summary, actors, etc.). 
(This should be dynamically created with JS, without a separate HTML page - 
Single Page Application logic). 
● My Favorites: Media selected by the user via the “add to favorites” button is stored in the browser using localStorage 
and displayed in a separate “My Favorites” section. 
Option 2: JavaScript-based SPA (Single Page Application) Portfolio Site 
Goal: To design a personal portfolio site that dynamically manages all content on a single HTML page using JavaScript (without page refreshes), unlike traditional multi-page sites. 
Technologies: HTML5, CSS3 (Animations), JavaScript (ES6+), DOM Manipulation. 
Required Features:
● Dynamic Page Loading: When links in the menu (e.g., “About Me,” “My Projects,” “Contact”) 
are clicked, the page should not refresh; the content of the relevant section should be loaded into the main content area 
using JavaScript. 
● URL Management: The browser's address bar should be updated even though the page does not change 
(e.g., .../index.html#myprojects). 
● Contact Form: A contact form with HTML5 form validations and additional validations using JS. (The Submit button should only display a “Submitted” message, 
no backend is required). 
● Responsive Design: The menu should turn into a “hamburger menu” on mobile devices. 
4. Mandatory Technical Issues to Implement 
(Checklist) 
All of the following concepts (those appropriate for your chosen project) must be implemented in your project:
● HTML5 & CSS3:
○ Use of semantic HTML (<nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, etc.).
○ Responsive Design (Media Queries and Flexbox/Grid). 
● Modern JavaScript (ES6+): 
○ Use of const and let (var should not be used). 
○ Arrow Functions (=>). 
○ async/await and Promise (especially with fetch). 
● Asynchronous JavaScript: 
○ fetch() API (for external API or local JSON). 
○ Processing the returned JSON data and pushing it to the DOM.
● Data Management and Forms: 
○ Use of localStorage (in projects where required). 
○ HTML5 form validations and/or custom validations using JS. 
5. Project Presentation (Video Explanation) - MANDATORY 
After completing the project code, each student must record a video explaining their project. 
● The video should be no longer than 10 minutes. 
● At the beginning of the video, the student's face should be clearly visible, and the student should state their name, 
surname, and student number aloud. 
● The video must show a working demo of the project (via GitHub Pages).
● Important parts of the code (e.g., fetching data, page navigation logic for SPA, 
localStorage usage, etc.) must be explained.
● The video must be uploaded to YouTube as “Unlisted.” 
6. Evaluation Criteria
● Meeting Requirements (%30): All mandatory functions of the selected project must work correctly and without errors.
● Code Quality and Architecture (%20): Clean, readable, and manageable code (separation of HTML/CSS/JS, 
correct use of functions, semantic HTML). 
● JavaScript and Web API Usage (15%): Effective use of modern JS (ES6+), fetch, async/await, and 
localStorage. 
● Git and GitHub Usage (10%): Regular committing of the project from day one. 
Meaningful commit messages. Smooth deployment via GitHub Pages. 
● Video Presentation (10%): Clear, concise, and compliant presentation of the project (duration, audio, face visibility).
● Responsive Design (RWD) (10%): Seamless and aesthetically pleasing appearance of the application on mobile and desktop devices. 
● User Interface (UI/UX) (5%): Clean, understandable, and aesthetically pleasing design.
7. Bonus Scoring 
Students who go beyond the mandatory requirements and add extra and creative features to their project (e.g., adding PWA 
(Progressive Web App) features, intensive use of CSS animations/transitions, 
using Web Workers, complying with accessibility (A11y) standards, etc.) 
will receive bonus points in addition to their evaluation score. 
8. Submission
Submission consists of two stages: GitHub and the Student Information System (SIS). 
1. GitHub: 
● Each student must create their own private repository using the following GitHub Classroom link: https://classroom.github.com/a/Xg2jV1i2  
● The project development process will be carried out through this repository. 
● The repository's root directory must contain a README.md file briefly introducing the project. 
● The project must be published using GitHub Pages, and this live link must be added to the repository's description section.
2. Student Information System (OBIS):
● A .txt file named OgrenciNo.txt (e.g., B201210001.txt) will be uploaded to the relevant assignment submission section in OBIS.
● This .txt file should only contain 4 lines: 
● This .txt file should only contain 4 lines:
1st Line: Student Number First Name Last Name (e.g., B201210001 Ali Yılmaz)
2nd Line: GitHub Repository Link (e.g., https://github.com/kullanici-adi/proje-repo-adi) 
3. Line: Live GitHub Pages Link (e.g., https://kullanici-adi.github.io/proje-repo-adi/) 
4th Line: YouTube Video Tutorial Link (Must be outside the list)
IMPORTANT WARNING:
No excuses will be accepted if the GitHub Pages link does not work, the repository is private, or the video link is incorrect 
(private, public, etc.). 
Deadline: December 21, 2025, 11:59 PM (Your final GitHub commit and OBIS upload on this date 
will be evaluated.) 
Best of luck.
